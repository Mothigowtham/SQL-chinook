## In this project, I have performed a few queries to answer my data driven business questions:

1. Which albums sold the most tracks? Also mention the artists of those albums.
2. List each employee's name and designation along with their manager's name and designation.
3. Categorise each customer according to their total purchase value.
4. View Best selling artists.
5. When the customer asks for a track name that contains the words 'out loud' in it but can't remember the full song name.
6. Calculate each playlist's track count and length.
7. View Customers from India.
8. Enlist the list of customers who spend more than 100 dollars and live outside the USA (Using VIEW).
9. Find total cost of each genre in the store (Use multiple WITH).
10. Best customer in each country and their total purchase.
11. What genres that sell the most in the USA and their market share.
12. Total sales in each country along with their total sales.
